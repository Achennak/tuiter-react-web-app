        <p>Throughout the Infinity Saga, the MCU bid farewell to several major heroes, including Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man, Chris Evans' Captain America, and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow. With the culmination of the Multiverse Saga now at the forefront of discussion following the announcement of The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars, speculation is already rife as to how they could return in 2025.</p>

            <p>Even with these heroes gone, their legacy continues to be pivotal to many Phase 4 and 5 projects.

            Nonetheless, fans continue to call for the MCU's original heroes to return, and the topic continues to arise in interviews with these actors. All of them have followed a similar "never say never" theme, but most agree it would take the right story to make it happen, and the opportunities are now more clear than ever.

            Now that the MCU has established time travel and the Multiverse, the possibilities are endless as to how the fallen Avengers could come back in the near future. Many have speculated the original Avengers will be back for Secret Wars, but one theory explains how they could return as soon as The Kang Dynasty in May 2025.</p>

    <p>Although it was never addressed, Newt Scamander from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them briefly appeared in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Taking place during the 1920s through to the 1930s, the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them movies serve as a prequel series to the Harry Potter films. As such, the Fantastic Beasts movies included references and some characters who crossover to Harry Potter. For example, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore featured prominent Harry Potter characters, including Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall. The Fantastic Beasts films also included major locations and concepts, such as Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and the Deathly Hallows. In contrast, the Harry Potter movies included very few references to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which makes sense given that the Harry Potter films were created first. However, one notable Easter egg was when Newt Scamander appeared on the Marauder’s Map in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.</p>
    <p>While this was a fun Easter egg, it also raises the question of why Newt Scamander was in Hogwarts during Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Considering the length of time between the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Harry Potter films, it seems unlikely that Newt would have a reason to visit to Hogwarts. In addition, Newt was expelled from Hogwarts when he was a student, making his return even less likely. However, one theory justifies Newt’s appearance on the Marauder’s Map. It is possible that Newt may have been in Hogwarts to try to save Buckbeak, the hippogriff, from execution. This makes sense given Newt’s background and the Harry Potter timeline.</p>
